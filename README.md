# Cisco SNA UI New Hire Test

## Directions:

Create a new application that displays Employee information.
The application should contain a `Dashboard` page and an `Add Employee Form` page.

The `Dashboard` page should do the following:

- Display employee information in a table
- Allow to sort all table columns in ascending and descending order
- Load application data from the supplied JSON file
- Contain an `Add Employee` button, which navigates to the `Add Employee Form` page
- Update the employee table after adding a new employee

Use the attached wireframe as an example of how the application should generally look.

## Tools:

Write the application using a JavaScript library of your choice.
Test the application using a technology of your choice.

## Extra Credit (not required):

Display the charts in the wireframe using a chart library of your choice.

- Display a pie chart showing the number of employees by Job Title
- Display a bar chart with the number of employees by Gender

## Example Test Cases:

- I can build the project and run the application as per instructions given
- I can run a test suite against the project
- I can directly navigate to the `Dashboard` page or `Add Employee Form` page
- Navigating to the `Dashboard` page should show a loading indicator until it loads the data (hint: Use Network Throttling in Dev Tools)
- I can enter information in the `Add Employee Form` page and have it handle input validation
- After adding a new employee, I should see it in the `Dashboard` page table

_NOTE: This is not the complete set of test cases_

## Tips

- Create clean code
- Use modern APIs. Assume that no IE support is required
- Describe the assumptions behind your implementation and what improvements you could make if you had more time

## Deliverable Submission:

When complete, please send a link to your project's Git repository.
